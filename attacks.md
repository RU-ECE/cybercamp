## Projects

- Research how to prevent cyber attacks
- write a program to read in a dictionary and encrypt all words to compare as AES-256  passwords
- write a program to read in a dictionary and add words with alternate spellings where lowercase l can be replaced by 1, e can be replaced by 3, etc.
- write a program to digitally sign then encrypt a message and send it
