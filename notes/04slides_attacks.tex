Attacks

Plaintext attack
    if a message is known, reconstruct the key and use it to break other messages

DNS attack
    redirect lookup of domain names to a malicious server that will give a fake server
    If this leads to poisoning the certificate server, then communication to all servers will be intercepted

Breaking RSA through a plaintext Attack
    Beyond the scope of this workshop, but RSA can be broken, so we only use random numbers

Breaking RSA using Schorr's algorithm and a quantum computer
    The NSA has ordered all ISPs to start transitioning to a new cryptosystem.
    RSA will not be safe when there are quantum computers with 400 qbits capable of staying up long enough.
    This has not been done yet, but when it is done, suddenly https:// would no longer be safe.

VPNs
    NORDVPN, Surfshark, ExpressVPN, ProtonVPN, PIA 
    A VPN encrypts all traffic typically using AES-256.
    This means your ISP cannot evesdrop and know what you are doing.
    Of course, the VPN could be forced to eavesdrop by a government, so the location and policies of the VPN provider
    are very important.

    There have been hugely successful attacks on VPNs, so they are not foolproof
