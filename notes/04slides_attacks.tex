\begin{frame}{Cryptographic Attacks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cryptography is different than other areas of computer science
    \item Bugs are not merely passive
    \item People actively try to find bugs and exploit them to achieve results
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Plaintext attack}
    \item Given knowledge of a message contents
    \item Reconstruct the key and use it to break other messages
    \item Example:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item message: 00 00 00 00 65 66 67 68
        \item XOR encryption, key 4B
        \item Compute the message
        \item Can you determine the key from the encrypted message?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{RSA Plaintext attack}
\begin{itemize}
    \item More complicated than the previous
    \item RSA can be broken by a plaintext attack
    \item RSA is also computationally expensive
    \item Therefore: we only send random numbers through RSA
    \item Use the Random numbers to construct a joint key (Diffie-Hellman)
    \item Use AES-256 to encrypt the actual message
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{DNS attack}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Redirect lookup of domain names
    \item Build a malicious server that will mimick the real one
    \item Direct the computer to a fake certificate Authority
    \item All access to named web servers can then be faked
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{VPN attack}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A VPN uses encryption (typically AES-256)
        \item So local providers cannot see who you are talking to
        \item Safer, particularly if you don't trust the network (hotels, foreign countries)
        \item VPNs: NORDVPN, Surfshark, ExpressVPN, ProtonVPN, PIA 
        A VPN encrypts all traffic typically using AES-256.
        This means your ISP cannot evesdrop and know what you are doing.
        Of course, the VPN could be forced to eavesdrop by a government, so the location and policies of the VPN provider
        are very important.
    
        There have been hugely successful attacks on VPNs, so they are not foolproof
        \end{itemize}

%Breaking RSA using Schorr's algorithm and a quantum computer
%    The NSA has ordered all ISPs to start transitioning to a new cryptosystem.
%    RSA will not be safe when there are quantum computers with 400 qbits capable of staying up long enough.
%    This has not been done yet, but when it is done, suddenly https:// would no longer be safe.
