# AI Prompting for cryptography programming examples

1. The following is a sample prompt to chatgpt (or another AI) to build a program that you can use to generate questions and answers for a breakout box.

```bash
write a python program to generate a binary file and put in:
1. an 8-bit unsigned integer 3
2. a 32-bit unsigned  integer 1024
3.a 64-bit integer 65537,
4. the ASCII string hello
5.  a UTF8 string with the chinese character for big
```

1. write a python program to generate a public and private RSA key and save to a file in .pem format. The program should be invoked using
```bash
python generate_rsa_key.py <filename>
```

1. Write a python program to generate a public and private ECC key in pem format. The program should be invoked using
```bash
python generate_ecc_key.py <filename>
```

1. write a python server that listens to a socket port and echoes whatever text is sent to it.
use the following command line and default to 9009 if the parameter is not passed.
```bash
python server.py 9090
