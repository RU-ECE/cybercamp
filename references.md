## My Class Notes from Other Courses

For both C++ and Java, I wrote books (about 200 pages). Each one has short summaries of each topic designed for people who don't want to read a lot.

I have a lot of innovations in my C++ course that I'm proud of, including:
- A quiz to show you what you know and don't know
- A pdf book of about 200 pages with summaries of many C++ topics in 1-2 pages each
- Loads of coding examples in a sequence, numbered
- A list of programs each containing a single bug with ranked difficulty. So 00 is easy if you know anything about the language, and 35 is a super-hard, subtle pointer bug

The Java course is not as sophisticated as the C++ but a lot of you teach Java and might find the course notes useful. Same short summary approach, it's designed to supplement your regular materials.

My current course (Digital Logic Design). If you are interested you can join virtually. Learning how computers work will definitely make you a more sophisticated programmer. In this course I will be covering verilog, a digital design language. I have some innovations designed to allow grading a lot of homeworks with an enormous class (more than 200 students)

Processing is an amazing front end to Java and a graphical API. They also support python. This is the best way I know to teach programming, because it's fun, (graphics-centric), focuses on short programs with immediate intrinsic rewards, yet you can transition to full Java or C++ from there with almost no wasted time. Every statement you learn is Java. And I have a huge number of class examples and homeworks if anyone wants to contact me on that.

## News Articles

[Crowdstrike](https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/addressing-crowdstrike-outage)

What this article does not discuss is how did Syria manage to build most of the reactor in secret for years without Israel finding out?
I can't find the reference, but I read that everything was on paper. NO COMPUTERS! Inefficient, but far more secure.

How do you know that software you write is secure? Not only does it have to be safe, but every library or component you use has to be safe as well. Many attacks lately have been initiated by injecting malware into libraries which are used in hundreds or thousands of projects.
