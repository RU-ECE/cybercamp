# Research Projects in Security

* Research VPNs and determine which are best, in terms of price, coverage, and security.
  - Price
  - Number of computers and phones to be covered
  - Speed
  - Security of the codebase (do you trust them)
  - Legal location of the company
  - Policies of data retention
* Research RSA and why it is in danger
  - Schorr's algorithm
  - How big of a quantum computer do we need to break RSA?
  - AKS (Agrawal, Kayal, Saxena) Why is a paper from 2002 a cause for concern? [AKS Primality Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test)
  - Barak Survey paper. The ultimate concern is that one-way functions may not exist at all!
* What is a quantum-safe algorithm?
* How long are secrets safe?
* What is a good password?
  - Do letters and symbols matter?
  - length
  - dictionary words
  - find lists of common passwords: surprising how bad
* LastPass password manager
  - How was this password manager attacked?
  - Were passwords compromized?
  - How can this kind of problem be avoided?
* Avoiding sharing passwords
  - Is a password manager a good idea?
  - Stevens and Rutgers both use systems with a single sign on
    - Identify the benefits and risks
    - They both use 2fa on cellphones. How does this affect risk?
* Many banks and brokerages have common password protections
  - Lock up after a few failed retries
  - Call a human
  - They ask questions. Is this secure?
  - What are the problems with asking for private information to retrieve passwords (mother's maiden name, first pet, etc)
  - AI is currently making deepfake videos a possibility. How can this affect security?
